## Abstract

Beet Labs proposes the Canton Edge-Data SDK: open-source developer tooling that lets Canton and Daml developers pull authenticated physical-world sensor data into multi-party workflows, with sub-transaction privacy enforced at the protocol level.

Today's Canton ecosystem is strongest in institutional workflows, capital markets, DeFi, and regulated multi-party coordination. The SDK extends that strength into a new data source: physical-world edge devices. Hardware and IoT sensors generate data that is often sensitive, commercially valuable, or subject to regulatory access controls, exactly the category of information Canton's Daml authorization model and sub-transaction privacy were designed to handle.

The core value here is not hardware. It's a reusable Canton-native infrastructure layer: Daml templates for device registration, data submission, verification, and access control, a Ledger API v2 backend integration, and reference hardware adapters. This removes the need for each Canton developer team to build custom device-to-ledger infrastructure from scratch.

Beet, our ETHDenver 2026 first-place Canton track winner, is the reference implementation proving this architecture works end to end. This proposal generalizes that validated proof of concept into reusable public-good tooling for the Canton developer community.

## Specification

### 1. Objective

Canton developers building in capital markets, supply chain, pharmaceutical, and other regulated industries increasingly need to incorporate physical-world data into their Daml workflows. A bond settlement workflow may need verified custody sensor readings. A pharmaceutical distribution workflow may need authenticated cold-chain temperature data. A trade finance workflow may need verified physical-asset condition reports. Today, no reusable Canton-native tooling exists to connect edge devices to these workflows; each team builds custom device-to-ledger infrastructure independently, with no established patterns for Daml authorization, privacy, or event streaming in hardware contexts.

The Canton Edge-Data SDK eliminates this repeated work. Upon completion, a Canton developer can use the SDK to submit authenticated, hashed sensor output into their existing Daml workflow with appropriate signatory and observer access controls, without building the underlying integration layer themselves. The SDK is MIT licensed and fully open source.

Intended outcomes:

- Canton and Daml developers have reusable, well-documented tooling for integrating edge-device data into existing workflows
- Established Daml authorization patterns for hardware data contexts reduce development time and security risk for Canton teams
- The foundation exists for future regulated edge-data applications on Canton, across pharmaceutical, supply chain, capital markets, and industrial verticals
- Beet serves as a working reference application demonstrating end-to-end Canton edge-data integration

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The SDK is organized into three layers:

**Device Layer:** on-device firmware modules for ESP32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi that handle sensor reading, local SHA-256 hashing, payload construction, and transmission to the backend integration layer. Raw sensor data does not leave the device; Canton receives only a structured, hashed output.

**Backend Integration Layer:** a Ledger API v2 gRPC client that receives device payloads, constructs Canton commands, handles command deduplication, manages connection state, and subscribes to Canton event streams for real-time hardware-triggered workflow execution. Implemented in a language-agnostic manner, with reference implementations in Python and TypeScript.

**Daml Contract Layer:** a set of reusable Daml templates covering device registration and identity management, authenticated data submission with configurable signatory/observer patterns, verification and audit-trail contracts, access-control templates for regulated multi-party data workflows, and event-streaming patterns for real-time hardware-triggered workflow execution.

The three layers are designed to be independently usable. A Canton developer team with their own hardware setup can use only the Daml templates and backend integration layer. A hardware developer new to Canton can use all three layers together via the reference adapters.

### 3. Architectural Alignment

**Why Canton:** Canton's value proposition maps directly onto regulated edge-data workflows. Sub-transaction privacy lets a sensor reading carry different visibility for different parties (the operator sees raw data, the regulator sees aggregate signals, the counterparty sees a verified hash), enforced at the ledger level rather than the application layer. Daml's signatory/observer model makes these access controls part of the contract itself, not something an application-layer bug can bypass. Traditional databases require trusting the operator; public blockchains expose too much; generic permissioned chains rely on application-layer controls that can be bypassed. For hardware data touching HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GDPR, or commercial confidentiality requirements, Canton is the only production blockchain that meets the threshold requirement of not unnecessarily exposing raw data. Edge-data workflows also routinely span multiple organizations (sensor operator, data consumer, regulator, auditor), which is exactly what Canton's multi-party coordination model handles natively, without a trusted intermediary.

**Fit with the Development Fund and CIP process:** this proposal is submitted under the Development Fund established by [CIP-0082](https://github.com/canton-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0082/cip-0082.md) (the 5% Foundation-governed Development Fund) and governed by [CIP-0100](https://github.com/canton-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0100/cip-0100.md). The closest architectural precedent in the CIP Standards Track is [CIP-0103](https://github.com/canton-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0103/cip-0103.md) (dApp Standard), which formalizes reusable developer-facing patterns the same way this SDK formalizes device-to-ledger patterns. There is currently no CIP governing hardware or edge-device integration specifically; this SDK operates entirely at the application/tooling layer (a client library plus Daml templates), makes no protocol-level changes, and does not conflict with any Draft or Proposed CIP (e.g. CIP-0112 Token Standard V2, CIP-0117 Logical Synchronizers). If community interest in edge-data standardization grows, this SDK is a natural input to a future Standards Track CIP, but does not require one to ship.

**Honest read on current developer demand:** the Canton Foundation's Q1 2026 Developer Experience and Tooling Survey (41 active developers, January 20 to February 4, 2026) shows the community's loudest current asks are local dev frameworks, visual debugging, and typed SDKs/language bindings, not hardware integration specifically. We are not claiming edge-data is the top requested tool today, and we are saying that plainly rather than burying it. The case for this SDK rests on where Canton's institutional base already sits (custody, trade finance, pharma-adjacent settlement; see Motivation), positioning it ahead of where that demand is heading rather than reacting to where it already is. We expect reviewers to ask why we're not instead building one of the survey's top-voted gaps (a unified CLI, a visual debugger, better local dev frameworks). Our answer: those are real gaps, better addressed by teams with that specific expertise; ours is embedded systems plus production Canton/Daml integration, which is the differentiator this SDK is built around, and to our knowledge no other Dev Fund proposal (merged, open, or closed) targets hardware/edge-device integration specifically.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

No backward compatibility impact. The SDK is new, additive tooling, a client library and a set of Daml templates, and does not modify existing Canton protocol behavior, Ledger API interfaces, or any previously deployed contract. Adoption is opt-in: a developer imports the SDK into a new or existing workflow; nothing already running on Canton needs to change.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** documentation site publicly accessible; blog post published through Canton Foundation channels; recorded walkthrough published; **minimum 5 external Canton developers complete a working edge-data workflow using only published SDK documentation**, which is the milestone's real value metric, not the artifacts themselves; feedback report submitted; community maintenance structure documented and in place.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The Tech & Ops Committee will evaluate milestone completion based on:

- All specified deliverables completed and submitted for review
- Demonstrated functional operation or deployment readiness as applicable
- Documentation and knowledge transfer materials provided
- Alignment with stated value metrics

Project-specific acceptance conditions are listed per milestone above. The throughline across all four is that "done" means demonstrated ecosystem value (external validation, working testnet transactions, independent developer adoption), not internal artifact checklists alone.

## Funding

**Total Funding Request: 980,000 CC (approximately $147,000 USD at $0.15/CC)**

This is lower than an earlier draft's $165,000 ask, not because we cut scope, but because that draft had a $12,000 personnel line that wasn't itemized anywhere (the personnel table summed to $126,000; the budget summary said $138,000). We removed it rather than explain it away. Milestone 2's external-review requirement is now met through `daml-tooling` SIG / community review instead of paid consulting, which is where that gap likely came from. Scope, timeline, and team compensation are otherwise unchanged from the original plan.

For context on sizing: a comparable, merged Dev Fund proposal for Canton developer tooling (Canton DevKit, a local dev environment toolkit) requested 1,900,000 CC (approximately $285,000) across four milestones over 12 months, plus an optional 600,000 CC maintenance extension, and was approved. Our ask is well within the normal range for this kind of grant.

## Motivation

The Canton Dev Fund exists to build public-good infrastructure that benefits the entire Canton developer ecosystem. This SDK is squarely within that mandate.

Today, every Canton developer team that wants to incorporate physical-world sensor data into a Daml workflow must build the entire device-to-ledger integration layer from scratch: firmware, hashing pipeline, Ledger API client, Daml contract design, authorization patterns. There are no established patterns, no reusable templates, no reference implementations. The Canton Edge-Data SDK removes this repeated work permanently. Once it exists, any Canton developer can add authenticated hardware data to a workflow in a single development session rather than building the integration layer from scratch.

**On sizing this honestly:** we don't have a precise count of Canton developers specifically working on hardware/edge-data use cases, because that category doesn't yet exist as a tracked segment. What we do have: the Canton Foundation's Q1 2026 Developer Experience survey identified 41 active developers ecosystem-wide (80% of whom joined in the last 12 months), and Canton Wiki's ecosystem tracker counts 184+ projects, heavily concentrated in exactly the regulated, physical-asset-adjacent verticals this SDK targets: custody (DTCC, Broadridge's repo platform), trade settlement (Tradeweb, Euroclear), and institutional post-trade infrastructure. That's the honest basis for our M4 target: **5 external developers completing a working edge-data workflow is roughly 12% of the current active-developer base**, a conservative, checkable bar, not a growth projection we can't substantiate. If it lands, the natural follow-on is for the Foundation's existing pharma/custody relationships to pilot the SDK on a real production workflow; that pilot would be its own, separate proposal.

This is the same class of public-good contribution as the Daml training curriculum and prior developer-tooling proposals previously funded: infrastructure that benefits the entire ecosystem and does not need to be rebuilt by each team independently.

### Adoption Plan

The primary target users are existing Canton and Daml developers, not generic hardware engineers:

- **Canton developer portal submission** at Milestone 3, making the SDK discoverable to the existing developer community without active marketing
- **Technical blog post and walkthrough** at Milestone 4, reaching developers through existing Foundation channels at no separate marketing cost
- **Lightweight developer challenge** integrated with an existing Canton community event rather than a standalone hackathon; the goal is developer feedback from 5 to 10 developers, not event scale
- **Daml consulting network**: the `daml-tooling` SIG review built into M2's acceptance criteria creates a direct connection to experienced Canton developers who can validate the SDK and introduce it to their networks
- **Follow-on application pilots**: application-specific pilots (for example, a pharmaceutical firm integrating cold-chain sensors into an existing Daml workflow) are the natural next step once the SDK is validated, proposed separately once the tooling exists and has been tested by external developers

---

## Rationale

**Why does Canton need this SDK rather than relying on teams building their own integrations?** Every team incorporating hardware data into a Canton workflow today faces the same unsolved problems: Daml contract design for device identity and submission, signatory/observer patterns for regulated hardware data, a reliable Ledger API v2 backend, and Canton's specific privacy requirements. Without shared tooling, each team solves this independently, with inconsistent results, duplicated effort, and no shared community knowledge.

**Why Canton rather than other chains for regulated edge data?** Traditional databases require trusting the application operator. Public blockchains expose transaction data to all participants, categorically unsuitable for regulated hardware data. Generic permissioned chains typically rely on application-layer access control that can be bypassed by software bugs or misconfiguration. Canton's Daml authorization model enforces who can see what at the ledger level, through the contract model itself. For hardware data subject to HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GDPR, or commercial confidentiality requirements, this distinction is not a preference, it is the threshold requirement. Canton is the only production blockchain that meets it.

**Why this team?** The Canton Edge-Data SDK requires a rare combination of production embedded-systems experience and production Canton/Daml implementation knowledge. Beet is proof that this combination exists in Ria and Crystal: a working end-to-end hardware-to-Canton integration, validated under live competition conditions at ETHDenver 2026, judged by Canton's own technical team. This proposal generalizes that validated architecture into reusable tooling. The work is already partially done; what remains is the engineering to make it production-grade, reusable, and well-documented for the Canton developer community.

**Why MIT licensing?** Proprietary tooling creates adoption bottlenecks and concentrates control. An openly licensed SDK with clear documentation becomes a community asset that Canton developers can use, extend, and contribute to without friction. Every Canton team that builds on the SDK strengthens the shared infrastructure layer rather than duplicating it.

**Long-term maintenance:** the SDK will be actively maintained by Beet Labs for a minimum of 12 months post-grant delivery, covering bug fixes, security patches, dependency updates, and community PR review. Community contribution infrastructure is established from Milestone 3 onward, enabling external Canton developers to add new Daml templates or hardware adapters independently. Unlike proposals that involve recurring paid infrastructure (hosted APIs, ongoing service costs), this maintenance commitment has no ongoing cost to the fund; it's a standing commitment from the team, not a milestone deliverable.

**On the funding ask:** we're presenting the full, honestly costed scope here rather than a pre-shrunk version, on the view that a fully itemized ask the Committee can negotiate down is more useful to everyone than a smaller number that either under-resources the work or that we can't fully explain if asked. Reviewed Dev Fund proposals show this negotiation happens routinely and productively: proposals get revised through committee dialogue (added detail, adjusted milestones, corrected assumptions) rather than accepted or rejected outright on the first pass. If the Committee determines a different scope or amount is more appropriate here, we're glad to revise.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Daml template design requires more iteration than anticipated | Medium | `daml-tooling` SIG / external developer review built into M2 acceptance criteria catches design issues before M3 hardware work begins |
| Hardware supply chain delays | Low | Hardware quantities are small; standard components available from multiple suppliers; 15% spare-component buffer included |
| Low external developer uptake at M4 | Medium | Developer challenge integrated with existing Canton events minimizes friction; documentation site and walkthrough video reduce onboarding barrier; target of 5 developers is approximately 12% of the Foundation's own surveyed active-developer base, a conservative, checkable bar |
| Edge-data is not yet a top developer-tooling priority per the Q1 2026 survey | Acknowledged | This proposal is framed as infrastructure for Canton's existing institutional verticals (custody, pharma-adjacent, trade finance), not as a response to the survey's top-voted asks (local dev frameworks, debugging); those gaps are better addressed by teams with that specific expertise, and this SDK is not competing with them for the same reviewer attention |
| Canton Ledger API v2 changes during development | Low | SDK targets stable Ledger API v2 interfaces; architecture documentation notes any version dependencies |
| Demand from Canton enterprise clients not yet established | Acknowledged | This proposal builds the tooling layer first; application-specific demand validation and enterprise pilots are the natural follow-on once the SDK exists and is tested; the Foundation's existing relationships in pharma and supply chain are the target audience for those follow-on conversations |
